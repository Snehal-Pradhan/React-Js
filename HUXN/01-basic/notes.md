### React is a free open source js library made to build uis

components are reusable bits of code, just like JS functions but work in isolation and return HTML.

based on separation of concern and component-model

components sre made for navbar,mainPanel,footer..

component should always start with a capital letter.

in react , render list is some type of loop. The JS map() array method is generally the preferred method.

props or properties are the argument passed into react components.

props allows us to pass data from parent component to a child component

conditional rendering  allows us to dynamically display different ui components or content based on specific conditions.

this enables us to create more interactive and responsive design user experienc.

state ->  state is a way to store and manage data which can change over time and affect how the components render

hook -> lets use state in a class less component.

useState hook => is a hook that allows us to track state in a functionl component.

portal - it is a feature that allows you to render a child component into a DOM node that exists outside the hierarchy of parent component. this can be useful for scenarios like modals , tooltips or drop downs , where you want to break out of the usual parent-child structure and render in a different part of DOM

When React detects a key change, it treats the element as new and fully re-renders it.

onChange is an event handler that runs whenever the input value changes.

state is a dynamic data container that React tracks and updates automatically.

UseEffect() is a hook which lets us perform side effects in your components.

context API => is a feature that allows us to manage and share state across your component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. its useful for scenarios where you need to share data or funtions across many components especially when these components are deeply nested.
